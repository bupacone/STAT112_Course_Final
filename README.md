# Introduction to Data Processing and Data Visualization (STAT112) Final Project

The STAT department offers this course at Middle East Technical University, and it requires us to clean and interpret the provided data using Python programming language and its libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn.

In this project, we worked on a small dataset of crime data. I completed most of the coding and visualization part by myself. I would like to thank my other teammates for their help with reporting.
